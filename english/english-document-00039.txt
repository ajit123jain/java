"I don't know whether this is a marketing gimmick or not. Jhagda poorana ho gaya," Harbhajan said at a promotional event for futurebazaar.com website.   "Between the two of us, we had a spat but we sorted out the issue on the same night. It's not that we have been avoiding each other," he added.   Sreesanth also played down 'slapgate' incident and said, "If you want to fight with us, fight us for futurebazaar.com for cheap laptops."   Both the cricketers congratulated all the Indian athletes for their good show in the recently concluded  Commonwealth Games in Delhi and wished them all the best for the Asian Games in China next month. </content>
