<content> BANGALORE: A day after home minister V S Acharya did a volte-face on his remarks about Abdul Nasser Madani's alleged role in the twin  blasts near the cricket  stadium here, the City  Police on Wednesday said the PDP leader's involvement in the bombings "has not been proved so far".   Talking to reporters, Bangalore Police Commissioner Shankar Bidari said, "I would not like to comment on the home minister's statements. However, Madani's role in the stadium explosion has not been proved so far."   The twin blasts outside the Chinnaswamy cricket stadium ahead of an IPL match on August 17 had left 15 people injured.   Bidari hinted that Madani's wife Soofiya, who is listed as one of the witnesses, will also be questioned in connection with the July 25, 2008 serial bomb blasts in the city in which one woman was killed and 20 were injured.   Madani was listed as an accused in the additional charge sheet filed in the 2008 blast case after the confessions of the main accused T Nasser.   Acharya had stated yesterday that interrogation of Madani has revealed his role in the twin explosions near the stadium. But later he did a volte-face saying "I have been misquoted."   He had, however, said Madani's links with Nasser in the 2008 blasts had been "established" during interrogation.   Bidari said police might seek extension of Madani's custody, which will end tomorrow, if the need arises.   Madani was arrested at Kollam in Kerala on August 17 by Karnataka Police after an eight-day-long wait to execute the arrest warrant against the PDP leader.   He was also an accused in the 1998 Coimbatore serial bomb blast case in which 58 people were killed, but was acquitted by a trial court. </content>
