Mahatma Gandhi said my life is a message to the nation to see.   "Our leader Rajasekhara Reddy also belonged to the same league. His life is a message to the state of Andhra Pradesh. The way he lived and his affectionate way of wishing people is a message. I learnt a lot from him. One who spoke to him just once can learn a lot from him. I thank each one of you with folded hands for your love and affection," he said in the message. </content>
