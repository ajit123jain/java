<content> NEW DELHI: The  Speaker is the master of all procedures relating to transaction of business in Lok Sabha and minor irregularities in these can never be a ground to question his/her decisions in a court of law, the Supreme Court ruled on Monday.   "The business transacted and validity of proceeding (of Lok Sabha) after the resumption of its sitting pursuant to the directions of the Speaker cannot be inquired into by the courts," said a constitution Bench comprising Chief Justice K G Balakrishnan and Justices S H Kapadia, R V Raveendran, B Sudershan Reddy and P Sathasivam.   Similar logic was applied to Rajya Sabha by the Bench. "It is the right of each  House of  Parliament to be the sole judge of the lawfulness of its own proceedings. The courts cannot go into the lawfulness of the proceedings of the Houses of Parliament," said Justice Reddy, writing the judgment for the Bench.   The constitution Bench was clarifying a grey area pointed out by ex-MP Ramdas Athawale. He had said as per rules, Parliament's first session every year had to be addressed by the President. But the same was not followed when Parliament sat in January 2004. He had requested the court to declare the January 2004 session of Parliament as illegal.   Accepting attorney general G E Vahanvati's arguments, the Bench said the session was adjourned sine die on December 23, 2003 and when it had a sitting in January 2004, it was merely a resumption of the earlier session and was not the first session for the year 2004.   Dismissing Athawale's petition, it said, "The business transacted and the validity of proceedings after the resumption of sittings of the House pursuant to the directions of the Speaker cannot be inquired into by the courts. No decision of Speaker can be challenged by a member of the House complaining of mere irregularity in procedure in the conduct of the business."     </content>
