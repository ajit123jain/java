<title>Is Jaswant Singh on his way back into BJP fold? </title>

<content> NEW DELHI: Just months after their bitter divorce, prospects for a re-union of  BJP and Jaswant Singh have perked up.   An initiative taken by BJP veteran L K  Advani to build bridges anew with the dismissed leader has been reciprocated by Singh, setting the stage for homecoming from the exile he was sent into for praising the founder of  Pakistan M A Jinnah.   The speculation that the hatchet may formally be buried shortly got a fillip on Friday following Jaswant Singh's remark in an interview to a TV channel that he, having spent 32 years in the BJP, was finding it difficult to flush the party out of his system.   The decision to take Jaswant Singh back into the party fold may not be an easy one, given the objection raised by RSS to the contents of Jaswant's book on Jinnah.   BJP sources, however, hope that the obstacle can be unblocked by pointing to Jaswant Singh's age as also his long association with the BJP.  </content>
