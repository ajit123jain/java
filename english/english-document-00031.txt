<content> NEW DELHI: India on Sunday virtually ruled out handing over  Ajmal Kasab, the lone terrorist caught during the  26/11 strikes, or his associate Fahim Ansari to  Pakistan as it emphasised that "justice" was taking its course in this country in the Mumbai attacks case.   "We are trying Kasab and others here in India following the Mumbai terrorist attacks," foreign secretary Nirupama Rao said when asked to comment on Pakistan approaching  Interpol for arresting Kasab and Ansari for trial in that country.   "The case against Kasab has proceeded over the last few months. Verdict is expected by May 3 in all likelihood," she said, adding "justice is taking its course in India on this subject."   Pakistan's Special Public Prosecutor Malik Rab Nawaz Moon, during trial in the 26/11 case in Rawalpindi on Saturday, said Interpol had been approached to issue Red Corner Notice for arrest of Kasab and Ansari.   Kasab was one of the 10 Pakistani terrorists who attacked Mumbai on November 26, 2008. While nine terrorists were killed during 60-hour gun-battles, Kasab was arrested.   Ansari is accused of having conducted recce for the Mumbai attacks and prepared maps for the same.   Pakistan has arrested seven terrorists, including LeT operations chief Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi in connection with the Mumbai attacks. They are being tried at Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi.   The Lahore High Court has said the trial of the seven terrorists arrested in Pakistan could not be separated from that of Kasab and Ansari and they should be declared as proclaimed offenders or fugitives.   At this point, the defence lawyers said Kasab and Ansari were not fugitives as they were under custody of Indian authorities.   To a question on reports that the land of a temple in  Karachi had been grabbed, Rao said the government has sought details from the Indian High Commission in  Islamabad. </content>
