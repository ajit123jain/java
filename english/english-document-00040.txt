<title>India to project 'celluloid power' at Cannes </title>
<date>3-5-2010</date>
<content> NEW DELHI: India will kickstart its campaign to hardsell itself as a "growing celluloid power" at the 63rd  Cannes Film Festival. The festival, scheduled between May 12-23, will see the country project itself as an ideal destination for film shoots.   With films like  Angelina Jolie starrer "A Mighty Heart", Julia Roberts' '"Eat, Pray, Love" and " Slumdog Millionaire" under its belt, the I&B ministry hopes to encourage an increasing number of film production companies to explore the country. Workshops and seminars on India as an emerging animation hub, audio-visual co-productions, legal aspects of copyright and intellectual property are among the issues that will grab centrestage. Industry body Assocham, Directorate of Film Festivals (DFF) and the I&B ministry have collaborated on India's role and presence at the Cannes this year.   A major challenge for the ministry will be to get more film collaborations under the co-production agreements signed with countries like  UK, Germany and Brazil. Despite the agreements, awareness has been low with few takers on the project. DFF will also be putting together a panel on regional cinema. "There is a concerted effort this year to showcase the country's soft power in structured interaction through eminent personalities and forums," an official said.   So if the panel on projecting India as a filming destination will have celebrated director  Shekhar Kapur participating, the panel on regional cinema will see Film Federation of India president L Suresh. Among other major industry names participating are Jahnu Barua, Anurag Kashyap and Bobby Bedi.   There will be a special session recognizing veteran director Mrinal Sen's contribution to world cinema. Sen's 1983 classic "Khandahar" will be screened at the classic section of Cannes. The renowned director will be present during the screening. </content>
