It is believed that the man, whose identity has not been revealed, also played a large role in assisting Iraqi troops during the 1990 Invasion, documents recently obtained have said.   The man is assumed to have been the head of the Saddam Martyrs Brigades during the invasion and was employed by the  Iraq regime's office in Basra at the time, an Arabic 'Al-Watan Daily' report has said.   He and his family are thought to have worked as spies for the  Baath Party in  Kuwait and to have received letters of acknowledgment from the Iraqi regime until it fell in 2001.   Letters obtained by the daily said that the individual provided the head of the Basra governorate's organizations supervisor the locations of Husainiyas, or Shiite mosques, in Kuwait and areas with Shiite majorities.   One such letter, dated September 1, 1990, contained mentioning of condolences from the Iraqi President  Saddam Hussein for the death of the suspect's brother during Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.   In another letter, the suspect mentions being honoured by the former Iraqi regime for his role in assisting Iraqi troops during the invasion.  </content>
