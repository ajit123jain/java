<content>  If they don't watch out, the realist director, known to make detailed films about any milieu of choice, might even set his next film in the alleys of the Censor Board.    For now, the second TV trailer of his next,  Dil Toh Bachcha Hai Ji, has run into trouble with the Censor Board.   The Censors have demanded that Bhandarkar mute two words from the trailer: 'sex'. Last heard, Bhandarkar had toed the line. "Or else, the Censors would refuse to give their nod of consent.   No amount of argument from officials of Bhandarkar Entertainment helped," says a source close to Bhandarkar.   Explaining the scenes which have these words, the source said, "The Censors objected to two scenes. The first scene in question has Omi Vaidya telling Ajay Devgn, 'Shaadi se pehle sex'.   The second scene in question has Emraan Hashmi asking Shruti Hassan about her hobbies, to which Shruti replies, "Mujhe pornography dekhna bahut pasand hai'.   When contacted, Bhandarkar admitted, "I did the needful. I had no choice, did I?"    Check out Madhur Bhandarkar's pics    Follow us on Twitter for more stories   </content>
