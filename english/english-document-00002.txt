<content> MUMBAI: After brickbats, it is now bouquets for cricket maestro  Sachin Tendulkar from Shiv Sena.   Sachin's double-hundred against South Africa in Gwalior has not only silenced his critics, but clean bowled the Shiv Sena, which had taken on the iconic batsman over his "Mumbai for all" remark.   "Hundred crore people of this country have already crowned Sachin as  Bharat Ratna," Sena chief  Bal Thackeray said in an editorial in party mouthpiece 'Saamana'.   "Shivaji Maharaj used to vanquish Moghuls on battlefield. Similarly, Sachin is a warrior on cricket battlefield. Such warriors are born only in Maharashtra," Thackeray said.   "Shivaji wielded the sword. Similarly, Sachin wields the bat," the editorial said.   "Sachin does not need anyone's recommendation to be awarded Bharat Ratna. He is already one," it said.   The  Shiv Sena leadership had last year questioned Tendulkar's loyalty to Maharashtra following his Mumbai for all remark. </content>
