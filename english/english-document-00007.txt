<content> LONDON: England have committed participation in  the Commonwealth Games but the first batch of athletes who would land in Delhi on Friday would put up at hotels instead of the  Games Village as it would be "several days" before their living quarters are ready.   English men's hockey team and the lawn bowling squad are among the 22-strong group of athletes, who flew from Heathrow last night.   But England chef de mission Craig Hunter said it would be some days before they move in to the Games Village, which has been dubbed "filthy and uninhabitable" by visiting international delegates.   "We will set up our athletes in local hotels," Hunter was quoted as saying by The Daily Telegraph.   "We don't want to move them in one day and then have to move them again. We want them to get over their jet lag and then move in when it's ready," he added.   Jason Lee, head coach of the hockey squad, said the travelling athletes are calm despite the furore over whether Delhi would be ready in time for the October 3 to 14 event given the troubled build-up.   "The feeling in the group varies from mostly very calm and collected to a couple who have some outstanding concerns but nothing that is going to stop them from getting on the plane," he said. </content>
