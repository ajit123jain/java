<content> MELBOURNE: With John Howard's bid thwarted by the Afro-Asian bloc, former Australian captain  Mark Taylor could be proposed as an alternate candidate for the  ICC vice-president's post by the cricket boards of  Australia and New Zealand.   According to a report in the 'Sydney Morning Herald', although Cricket Australia and  New Zealand Cricket continue to back Howard, they might propose Taylor by the August 31 deadline set by the ICC.   "Mark Taylor could be floated as an alternative candidate to  John Howard for the ICC vice-presidency at a Cricket Australia board meeting next week," the report stated quoting sources.   Howard was rejected by the Afro-Asian members of the ICC Executive Board and though no specific reasons were given for the snub, there is speculation that the former Australian Prime Minister was seen as somebody with too little experienced and too much of a political baggage.   Although CA is seething in anger over Howard's rejection, it does not want the matter to drag too much, the newspaper reported.   Taylor, a successful Australian captain who was succeeded by  Steve Waugh, is a member of the ICC's cricket committee and CA's board.   NZC chief Justin Vaughan said the former Aussie captain is a perfect candidate but the issue would have to be discussed thoroughly before proposing his name.   "Mark Taylor is an outstanding individual. But I think it's too premature to be talking potential candidates at this stage. I think what we all need is to take some time to let the dust settle and reconvene at our respective board meetings," he said. </content>
